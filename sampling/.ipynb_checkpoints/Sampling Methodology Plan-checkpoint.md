# Sampling Methodology Plan

## Requirements
- A series of observational locational data that identifies tree outside of forests and not tree outside of forests within a select study area.
    - Standardize number of trees outside of forest observation
    - Standard randomly generated number of locations
    - standardize background imagery and naming conventions for areas and observations

- Develop a reference map and log system to see who is working on what sections and for tracking completions
    - Based on a fishnet grid of the State so that we develop expected training set based on proximetry or shared characteristics with sampled areas.
    - Tabular data to tracking
        - author; grid id; year; notes; validation author

- Validation protocol
    - Either two users generated set independently or

## Outstanding questions
- what is a reasonable area for performing this sampling process (base on computation constraints of the segmentation process.

## Connor's Notes 

- The sampling size I am testing first is the 12 square mile gridded feature set. 
- Aiming for 100 points in the precense set.
- Avoiding marking points directly next to each other. Long stands of trees get market in the thickest point with one marker.
- Approximate one hour for 100 hundred points precense set. 1 hour 30 for more forested areas (southeast especially) 
- Issues identifying dense tree stands from murky water in the wetland portion of the state (north central).
- Can usually differentiate between water and trees using different bands, unless water is algae covered which is common in the north.
- Tree cover does not change very often between 2010 to 2020. Usually use the opacity feature to check.
