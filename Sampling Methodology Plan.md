# Sampling Methodology Plan 

## Requirements
- A series of observational locational data that identifies tree outside of forests and not tree outside of forests within a select study area.
    - Standardize number of trees outside of forest observation 
    - Standard randomly generated number of locations 
    - standardize background imagery and naming conventions for areas and observations 
    
- Develop a reference map and log system to see who is working on what sections and for tracking completions 
    - Based on a fishnet grid of the State so that we develop expected training set based on proximetry or shared characteristics with sampled areas. 
    - Tabular data to tracking 
        - author; grid id; year; notes; validation author 

- Validation protocol 
    - Either two users generated set independently or 

## Outstanding questions 
- what is a reasonable area for performing this sampling process (base on computation constranst of the segmentation process.
