```{r}
# load libraries 
pacman::p_load(sf,dplyr,VSURF)
```

Might want to include the develop training data script as a python call here... would need to work through setting the venv 

```{python}

```



```{r}
# define grid ID 
## this is the primary path related structure so it's im
gridID <- "X12-150"
year <- 2016
```



```{r}
# source functions 
source("~/GitHub/Agroforestry/agroforestry/0b_vsurf.R")
source("~/GitHub/Agroforestry/agroforestry/0c_gettingNeighborGrids.R")

# define data path 
dataPath <- "~/GitHub/Agroforestry/data"
exportPath <- paste0(dataPath, "/processed/", gridID)
```



Edit the traing dataset 
```{r}
# define file path for inport and export 
  filePath <- paste0(dataPath,"/processed/", gridID)
  # grab all options 
  files <- list.files(filePath, pattern = "agroforestrySamplingData",
                     recursive = TRUE,
                     full.names = TRUE)
  #select specific year 
  file <- files[grepl(x = files, pattern = year)]
  # read in feature
  data <- file |>
    st_read()|> 
    dplyr::mutate(presence = case_when(
      presence == 1 ~ 1,
      TRUE ~ 0
    ))
data$random <- runif(nrow(data))

sf::write_sf(data, file, delete_dsn =TRUE)


```


run variable selection using vsurf
```{r}
rankPredictors <- variableSelection(gridID = gridID,dataPath = dataPath, year = year)
#export to a file location 
write.csv(x = rankPredictors, file = paste0(exportPath, "/variableSelection",year,".csv"))
```


generate the subgrid features 

```{r}
nGrid <- defineNeighborGrid(gridID = gridID, dataPath = dataPath)
write.csv(x = nGrid, file = paste0(exportPath, "/neighborGrids.csv"))
```
