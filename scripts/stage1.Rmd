```{r}
# load libraries 
pacman::p_load(sf,dplyr,VSURF)
```

Might want to include the develop training data script as a python call here... would need to work through setting the venv 

```{python}

```



```{r}
# define grid ID 
## this is the primary path related structure so it's im
gridID <- "X12-601"
```


```{r}
# source functions 
source("~/GitHub/Agroforestry/agroforestry/0b_vsurf.R")
source("~/GitHub/Agroforestry/agroforestry/0c_gettingNeighborGrids.R")

# define data path 
dataPath <- "~/GitHub/Agroforestry/data"
exportPath <- paste0(dataPath, "/processed/", gridID)
```

run variable selection using vsurf
```{r}
rankPredictors <- variableSelection(gridID = gridID,dataPath = dataPath)
#export to a file location 
write.csv(x = rankPredictors, file = paste0(exportPath, "/variableSelection.csv"))
```


generate the subgrid features 

```{r}
nGrid <- defineNeighborGrid(gridID = gridID, dataPath = dataPath)
write.csv(x = nGrid, file = paste0(exportPath, "/neighborGrids.csv"))
```
