# description of the modeling and segementation workflow 

- Utilize Functions to complete specific steps. 




### Organized at the Collection Grid level

**inputs** : lat lon values from a relivent sampling location 

1. Spilt the collection grid into smaller segements 

2. Pull naip imagery from earth engine for each segement (python)

3. Aggregate imagery to a scale that is approprate for the RF and segementation work 

4. generate indices uses in the modeling process 

5. generate a segmentation model 

## questions 
- not sure about the sequence of the segementation and RF modeling process 

- working exclusiveling in GEE might be a reasonable option as well.
