# At a little bit of a loss on how to pull this off at the momement due to the difficultly in managing functions but here is a current ideal 


## Things I might want to itorate over

### Testing 
# SNIC model parameters
# input training data class 
# RF model parameters 
## outputs
# maybe a visual features 
# error matrix against test train spilt 
# ideally we can generate a set of models and produce a dataframe of output accessments. 


### applying 
# collection years 
# classification areas
